# VanishHarmony
Light weight vanish plugin written in Harmony.<br>
Allows bypassing of locks and enables noclip while in vanish.<br>
On unvanish fully resets all triggers and colliders so puzzels and traps work straight away.<br>
If disconnected while in vanish will teleport and unvanish you on a random sleeping bag you own. Other wise will use native beach spawn points.<br>
